The file run_replication_firm.do reproduces the firm-level analysis presented in Section 6 when used in conjunction with the file firm_level.dta.

It requires as an input the Stata file firm_level.dta containing Compustat firm-level data together with firm-level geopolitical risk.

Instructions on how to build the firm_level.dta file are in the firm_documentation section. 

For testing purposes, this directory only contains the firm_level_shuffled.dta file which is a scrambled version of the original firm_level.dta file. 

Accordingly, calling the file firm_level_shuffled.dta WILL NOT reproduce the results in the paper.

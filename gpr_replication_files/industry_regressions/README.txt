The file run_replication_industry.do uses daily GPR and daily returns from the Fama-French library and Compustat (contained in the file fama_french_equal_gpr.dta) to construct industry-level exposure to geopolitical risk as described in the paper and generates the plot of industry exposure in the appendix of the paper.

The industry exposure coefficients are used in the firm-level analysis.
